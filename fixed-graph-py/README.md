## prototyping a fixed computational graph

<br>

a high-level way of thinking about zero-knowledge proofs is to prove a statement where:

> a function `f` evaluated at inputs `x_i` results in an output `(y_1,...,y_n)`, i.e., `f(x_1, ..., x_n) = (y_1, ..., y_n)`. 


this function can be expressed as a fixed computational graph, where nodes are integers and relationships between nodes are related by operations such as **multiplication or addition relationships**. this graph defines a symbolic graph, which is filled in a later operation. 

in addition, some nodes can be related to others with an **equality relationship** on which the node's value is computed outside of the graph and constrained by a **hint**.

### setting up

<br>


```bash
âžœ tree .
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ examples.py
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ graph.py
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ utils.py
â”œâ”€â”€ tests
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ test_examples.py
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ test_graph.py
â””â”€â”€ tox.ini
```

<br>

this project utilizes [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to set a customized virtual environment and installation:



```bash
âžœ brew install poetry
âžœ make install
```

<br>

configuration details can be found at `pyproject.toml`. in addition, an `.env` file should be created, and the logging level should be set to its environment variable:


```bash
âžœ cp .env_example .env
âžœ vim .env
```

<br>

note that even though the project has only one environment variable, this design choice is the most appropriate for production code.

### running examples without constraints

<br>

two examples of quadratic and cubic polynomial equations are illustrated in `src/examples.py`, and can be run with `LOG_LEVEL=debug` as follows:

```bash
âžœ make example

<br>

or, with `LOG_LEVEL=info`:

```bash

âœ… â†’ Found addition: 160 + 3 = 163
âœ… RESULT: 163
```

### running examples with constraints

<br>


a simple API (starter) to `hint` arbitrary nodes is available, and it natively supports asynchronous hints and support for parallelization for filling the graph.

an example is illustrated at `src/examples.py`, which can be run with `LOG_LEVEL=debug`:


```bash
âžœ make api

âœ… CALCULATING: f(x) = 8 / (x + 1), x = 3:
ðŸŸ¨ New graph created with root node at 0x100f5a960
ðŸŸ¨ Constant node with val=1 created at 0x100f5a8a0
ðŸŸ¨ Addition node for ['0x100f5a960', '0x100f5a8a0'] created at 0x100f5a9f0
ðŸŸ¨ Equality node for 0x100f5a9f0 created at 0x100f5aa20
ðŸŸ¨ New graph created with root node at 0x100f5a900
ðŸŸ¨ Constant node with val=8 created at 0x100f5a9c0
ðŸŸ¨ Multiplication node for ['0x100f5a900', '0x100f5a9c0'] created at 0x100f5a990
ðŸŸ¨ Starting filling nodes with x=3
âœ… â†’ Found constant: 1
âœ… â†’ Found addition: 3 + 1 = 4
âœ… â†’ Found equality: exiting at constrained node val=4
ðŸŸ¨ Getting last constrained node from graph at 0x100f5a960
ðŸŸ¨ Starting filling nodes with x=4
âœ… â†’ Found constant: 8
âœ… â†’ Found multiplication: 4 * 8 = 32
ðŸŸ¨ Finished filling nodes for graph at 0x100f5a900
âœ… RESULT: 32

ðŸŸ¨ Nodes 0x100842990 and 0x100842840 are equal with val=4
âœ… All constraints were met
ðŸŸ¨ Finished filling nodes for graph at 0x100842ab0
âœ… RESULT: 4
```

<br>

or, with `LOG_LEVEL=info`:

```bash
âœ… CALCULATING: f(x) = 8 / (x + 1), x = 3:
âœ… â†’ Found constant: 1
âœ… â†’ Found addition: 3 + 1 = 4
âœ… â†’ Found equality: exiting at constrained node val=4
âœ… â†’ Found constant: 8
âœ… â†’ Found multiplication: 4 * 8 = 32
âœ… RESULT: 32

âœ… All constraints were met
âœ… RESULT: 4
```

<br>

in addition, the examples above are also wrapped with a CLI tool, which could be run with: 

```
âžœ  python src/main.py
usage: main.py [-h] [-e] [-a]

ðŸ‘¾ Fixed Computational Graph Example ðŸ‘¾

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -e          Run examples for quadratic and cubic polynomial functions.
  -a          Run an example that utilizes a hint for a constrained none.
```

<br>

Once again, this design choice was picked to enhance the project's characteristics of production code. For instance, it would be straightforward to extend this CLI tool to accept hint inputs for arbitrary nodes, and to create visual graph plots based on the node type at `Node()`, among other features.
