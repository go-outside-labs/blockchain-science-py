## my cryptography experiments


<br>

* **[fixed-graph-py, generating zero-knowledge proof symbolic graphs](https://github.com/go-outside-labs/blockchain-science-py/tree/main/fixed-graph-py)**:
    * in zkps we want to prove a statement where `f` evaluated at `x_i` results in `(y_1,...,y_n)`, i.e., `f(x_1, ..., x_n) = (y_1, ..., y_n)`. this can be expressed as a fixed computational graph, where relationships between nodes are related by operations such as **multiplication or addition**. in addition, some nodes can be related with an **equality relationship** on which the node's value is computed outside of the graph and constrained by a **hint**.


<br>

* **[magick-py, a simple pir CLI tool](magick-py/):**
  * learn and run experiments to understand **zero-knowledge private information retrieval** through step-by-step mathematical calculations.

## my trading bots


<br>

* **[cointegration trading bots and CLI](cointegration-bots):**
  * run **highly customized** trading bots with **statistical algorithmic strategies** such as **cointegration**. Include an option for **docker deployment**.

## my jupyter notebooks

<br>

* **[extracting on-chain data from a list of ethereum public addresses](on-chain-data-by-address):**
    * given a list of **public addresses**, extract the current **token balance**, and parse the **transaction history** for token transfers/swaps.

<br>

* **[transfer events analysis through ethereum RPC API's `eth_getLogs`](transfer-events-analysis):**
    * leverage **[infura](https://docs.infura.io/infura/)**'s rpc url to retrieve and parse transfer events logs for a given erc20 token, calculating balances and token holders.

<br>

* **[leveraging uniswap subgraph to extract token pair information](uniswap-data):**
    * utilize the **graph explorer** to access **uniswap subgraph** and analyze the **UNI and WETH token pair** data. 

<br>

* **[DEXs analysis: PMM dodo, AMM uniswap V2, AMM curve stableswap](dexs-equations-analysis):**
    * maths && plots go-to for **decentralized exchanges analysis**.

<br>
    
* **[retrieving DAO tokens and pools data](dao-data):**
    * utilize the **graph explorer** to analyze the data related to a list of **DAO tokens**.

<br>

* **[messari API for token market data](messari-assets-data):**
    * utilize **[messari API](https://messari.io/api)** to retrieve **market data** for a list of tokens.

<br>

* **[leveraging moralis API to extract on-chain transactions, tokens, events, defi](moralis-tokens-and-txs):**
    * **moralis API** is a nice wrapper for several **on-chain calls** that would instead use several other native APIs and tools.
